"""The node daemon: a machine's tmux, driven by the hub over one websocket.

`agent-swarm-node` reads ~/.agent-swarm/node.toml (hub, token, node name),
dials the hub, and then does two things until told otherwise: executes the
commands the hub sends, and reports what its tmux looks like every few
seconds. It keeps no state of its own beyond a small store of claims and
results for commands with side effects, so the hub can resend one after a
reconnect without the agent seeing a message twice.

What the executor promises for a command with a side effect:

- it is claimed durably, by hub and op id, before anything touches tmux;
  a duplicate that arrives while the first is in flight is answered
  unknown rather than run, and one that arrives after gets the settled
  result; a claim left in flight by a crash becomes unknown at the next
  start and is never run
- it is checked for expiry, and for still belonging to the current hub
  session, immediately before the first tmux call, after any attachment
  fetching; nothing can undo a paste, so nothing is checked after it
- commands on one pane run one at a time, waiting without holding a worker
- admission is bounded: past the limit a command is refused at once
