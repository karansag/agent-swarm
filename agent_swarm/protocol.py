"""What a node and the hub say to each other over one websocket.

Every frame is a JSON object with a "type". The node dials the hub, so the
hub never needs to reach a node's address, and the node never listens.

    node -> hub   hello     once, first: who I am and what I can do
                  observe   every interval: my panes, and captures of the
                            ones the hub watches; doubles as the heartbeat
                  result    the outcome of one command, by op id
    hub -> node   welcome   the interval to observe at, the panes to watch
                  watch     the watched panes changed
                  command   do something; carries an op id and a ttl

Commands with side effects (deliver, spawn, kill, tag_pane, rename_window)
are idempotent by op id on the node: a command the hub resends after a
reconnect gets the earlier result back rather than running twice. The ttl
is in seconds from when the node receives the command, not an absolute
time, so the two clocks never have to agree.
