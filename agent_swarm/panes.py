"""One-time move of registrations from positional addresses to tmux pane ids.

Rows stored before pane ids hold `session:window.pane` (or, from some
clients, a bare %N with no record of which tmux server issued it). Neither
is trustworthy on its own: positions get reused and renumbered, so the pane
at a stored address today may hold a different agent. A row is bound to a
pane id only when the pane agrees with it; everything else is left offline
until the agent registers again (it can reclaim its handle with --name).
