"""Moving agents, teams, and tasks from one hub's database to another.

A machine that ran its own agent-swarm has agents, teams, and a task board
of its own. `read` turns that database into a bundle: a plain dict, written
as JSON, carried to the hub by hand. `plan` decides what the hub would do
with it, and is pure, so the decisions can be shown before anything is
written (`--dry-run`) and tested without a database. `db.apply_import`
computes a plan and performs it inside one write transaction, so a
registration that lands in between cannot invalidate the names it chose.

What does not travel: attachments (their bytes are on the other machine),
pane addresses (meaningless here), and node tokens. An imported agent
arrives as a reservation, an offline row holding its handle until the
agent registers here through the node daemon. Imported messages are
history: they are written as they were recorded, never delivered again,
and tagged so that task numbers inside their text read as the old board's.
