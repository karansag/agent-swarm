// double quotes the shell keeps \n as two characters, so the message has no
// line breaks at all, only literal backslash-n. Such a message is shown with
// its \n as line breaks. A message that already has real line breaks used
// any \n on purpose (a prompt template, a shell command) and is left alone,
// as is anything inside `backticks`. Display only: the stored text and what
// agents receive are unchanged.
